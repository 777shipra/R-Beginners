![LAW OF LARGE NUMBER](https://github.com/777shipra/R-Beginners/blob/master/Basics%20of%20Language/HOMEWORK%20EXERCISE/law%20of%20large%20number.png)

to explain this lets take an example of COIN TOSSES

lets say we have n coin tosses thats what the "n" in the above equation stands for so 
* again assuming n=100 (100 coin tosses)
* measuring for the value of heads / tails in the 100 coin tosses 
* 1 for heads and 0 for tails
* the value 1/0 is X in the above equation
* LHS OF THE EQUATION MEANS : that we are taking the average x of the value of n for example we have 50 heads of total 100 tosses so value would be = 0.5 
* RHS MEANS : the expected value of x

we can say that in the total 100 coin tosses the expected value of heads is 50 and tails is 50 that is 0.5

#####LLN states that as your n grows (n->infinty) your average of the actual value x (on the LHS) goes closer to the expected value E(x)

from above example we said that the E(x)=0.5=50% , lets see how the value of (heads/tails) approaches to E(x) value as we are increasing the value of n from 10 - 1000

NO OF COINT TOSSES | HEADS /TAIL VALUE (X bar n) | E(X) VALUE 
------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------
10 | 7 HEADS / 3 TAILS | 70%/30%
100 | 52 HEADS/48 TAILS | 52%/48%
1000 | 502 HEADS/ 498 TAILS | 50.2%/49.8%


Here we can see that as we increase the number of coin tosses the value actually moves closer to 50% . this is the LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS

# NORMAL DISTRIBUTION

Earlier in this section we used the rnorm() which is based on the normal distribution
this is how the normal distribution looks like

![NORMAL DISTRIBUTION](https://github.com/777shipra/R-Beginners/blob/master/Basics%20of%20Language/HOMEWORK%20EXERCISE/NORMAL%20DISTRIBUTION.png)

from the usage of the rnorm() , we saw that it generated the value in between -1-0-1 or between -2 & 2 and the likely hood of the rnorm function generating the number goes lower as the number moves further from -1 or 1 , can be interpreted from the graph

for example -> the likely hood of the number generated by the rnorm() between 0 and 1 is 34.1% 

# <------------HOMEWORK TASK ------------------>

WE ARE GOING TO TEST THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS .

STATEMENT:- TEST THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS FOR N RANDOM NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED NUMBERS WITH mean=0 and stdev=1
CREATE AN R SCRIPT THAT WILL COUNT HOW MANY OF THESE NUMBERS FALL BETWEEN -1 AND 1 AND DIVIDE BY THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF 10

YOU KNOW THAT E(X)=64.2 (see the normal distribution graph 34.1+34.1=62.2)

check that MEAN (X)N -> E(X) as you re run your script while increasing the value of N .

WRITE DOWN THE CODE and check your answer from the solution.R file .
