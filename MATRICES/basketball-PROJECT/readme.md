 # what are MATRICES ?
 Most of the data will be given to us in the form of table format and to operate with tables it is important to know about MATRICES
 
 we know that a vector in r is 
  1   2    3    4
 22 | 33 | 44 | 55
 -- | -- | -- | --
this contain only one dimention but tables contain more set of dimentions
(NOTE)-> matrices in general contain one or more dimention but in R one dimention is a vector as studied previously .

a table will look like this
